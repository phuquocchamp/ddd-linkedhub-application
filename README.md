# 🌐 DOMAIN DRIVEN DESIGN - LINKEDHUB APPLICATION

![LinkedHub Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=LinkedHub+Banner)  
*A professional networking platform inspired by LinkedIn.*

## 📋 Overview

LinkedHub is a professional networking platform inspired by LinkedIn, designed and developed using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and a **microservices architecture**. The project leverages **Java Spring Boot** to build scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled services. This repository contains the backend implementation of the LinkedHub system.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple microservices, each focusing on a specific domain of the application. Below is the structure of the modules:

- 🔐 **auth-service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and login functionalities.
- ⚙️ **config-service**: Manages centralized configuration for all microservices (e.g., using Spring Cloud Config).
- 🌍 **eureka-service**: Provides service discovery and registration using Netflix Eureka for microservices communication.
- 🚪 **gateway-service**: Acts as an API Gateway to route requests to appropriate microservices and handle cross-cutting concerns like security and load balancing.
- 👤 **profile-service**: Manages user profiles, including personal information, skills, and experiences.

### 📂 Additional Files

- 🐳 **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the setup for running all microservices and their dependencies (e.g., databases, Eureka) using Docker.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ☕ **Java Spring Boot**: For building RESTful microservices.
- ☁️ **Spring Cloud**: For microservices features like service discovery (Eureka), API Gateway, and centralized configuration.
- 🐳 **Docker**: For containerization of services.
- 📦 **Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Docker and Docker Compose
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd linkedhub
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Services Using Docker**: Start all microservices and their dependencies using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the Services**:

   - 🌐 API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`
   - 📊 Eureka Dashboard: `http://localhost:8761`

### 🖥️ Running Locally Without Docker

1. Start the `config-service` first to load configurations.
2. Start the `eureka-service` for service discovery.
3. Start the `gateway-service`, `auth-service`, and `profile-service` in any order.
4. Use an API client (e.g., Postman) to interact with the services via the API Gateway.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add more microservices for features like job postings, messaging, and news feed.
- Integrate a database for each microservice (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Add unit and integration tests for each service.
